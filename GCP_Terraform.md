I am working on google cloud + terraform to create BigQuery in a modularized way, so that the Terraform code could iterate over the directory to read all files which is the configuration related to bigquery dataset and respective tables in yaml format, and also refer to table schema in json format. Also suggest how to manage this as I want to deploy the same into all env starting from Dev to QA to Stage to Prod. Provide folder structure as well as terraform code with yaml and json config as mentione above.
Also at the path "config/datasets/" I will have multiple .yaml files each represent the dataset in google cloud bigquery and their respective tables configuration, as we define above. with terraform I have to read all yaml files or iterate over one by one and create dataset in goolg cloue bigquery. I am open for suggestion.




It sounds like you’re creating a robust and scalable setup for Google Cloud’s BigQuery using Terraform! Here’s a general approach to achieve this, including a suggested folder structure and some Terraform code:

description: "A description of my dataset"
tables:
  - name: "table1"
    schema: "${path.module}/../schemas/table1.json"
  - name: "table2"
    schema: "${path.module}/../schemas/table2.json"
Example Table Schema JSON Configuration (configs/schemas/table1.json)
json
[
  {
    "name": "column1",
    "type": "STRING",
    "mode": "NULLABLE"
  },
  {
    "name": "column2",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "REQUIRED"
  }
]
Moving Between Environments
To move between different environments (Dev, QA, Stage, Prod), ensure that each environment has its own configuration files under env/. The terraform.tfvars file can be used to override variables for each environment.

Initialize the environment:

sh
cd env/dev
terraform init
Plan the deployment:

sh
terraform plan
Apply the deployment:

sh
terraform apply
Replace dev with qa, stage, or prod for other environments. This approach ensures modularity, ease of maintenance, and consistency across all environments.

To handle multiple YAML files in Terraform and create BigQuery datasets and tables, you can use a combination of external scripts (like Python) to read and process the YAML files and then pass the data to Terraform via JSON. This approach ensures that you can easily manage multiple YAML files and create resources dynamically.

Here’s a suggested workflow:

Create a Python script to read and combine YAML files.

Convert the combined data to JSON.

Use Terraform to process the JSON data.

Python Script (scripts/combine_yaml.py)
This script reads all YAML files from the configs/datasets/ directory and combines them into a single JSON file.

python
import os
import yaml
import json

dataset_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../configs/datasets")
output_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../combined_datasets.json")

datasets = []

for filename in os.listdir(dataset_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".yaml"):
        with open(os.path.join(dataset_dir, filename), 'r') as file:
            datasets.append(yaml.safe_load(file))

with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    json.dump(datasets, file, indent=2)
Terraform Configuration
Update your Terraform module to read the JSON file generated by the Python script.

Terraform Module (modules/bigquery/main.tf)
hcl
variable "datasets" {
  description = "List of BigQuery dataset configurations."
  type        = list(any)
}

variable "project_id" {
  description = "GCP Project ID"
  type        = string
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
  for_each = { for dataset in var.datasets : dataset["name"] => dataset }
  
  dataset_id  = each.value["name"]
  location    = each.value["location"]
  description = each.value["description"]
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "table" {
  for_each = { for dataset in var.datasets : dataset["name"] => dataset["tables"] }
  
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.dataset[each.key].dataset_id

  dynamic "table" {
    for_each = each.value
    content {
      table_id  = table["name"]
      schema    = file(table["schema"])
    }
  }
}
Main Terraform File (env/dev/main.tf
.....
.....



----------------------------------------------------------

Since Terraform does not have built-in functionality for reading all files in a directory, we can achieve this by combining Terraform with an external tool like locals.tf to read and process all YAML files.

You can use a combination of Terraform with some pre-processing via a script to achieve this. Here's an approach using a simple shell script to generate a Terraform tfvars file that will combine all the YAML files into a single variable:

Step 1: Shell Script to Read YAML Files
Create a shell script (generate_tfvars.sh) to read all YAML files and generate a combined datasets.tfvars file.

sh
#!/bin/bash

output_file="datasets.tfvars"
dataset_dir="configs/datasets"

echo "datasets = [" > $output_file
for file in $dataset_dir/*.yaml; do
  echo "yamldecode(file(\"${file}\"))," >> $output_file
done
echo "]" >> $output_file
Make the script executable:

sh
chmod +x generate_tfvars.sh
Step 2: Run the Script
Before running terraform apply, execute the script to generate the datasets.tfvars file:

sh
./generate_tfvars.sh
Step 3: Use the Generated datasets.tfvars in Terraform
In your main.tf or variables.tf file, reference the datasets variable:

hcl
variable "datasets" {
  description = "List of BigQuery dataset configurations."
  type        = list(any)
}

# Include the generated datasets.tfvars file
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12"

  backend "local" {}

  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = ">= 3.5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  credentials = file("<PATH TO YOUR CREDENTIALS>.json")
  project     = var.project_id
  region      = var.region
}

module "bigquery" {
  source     = "../modules/bigquery"
  project_id = var.project_id
  datasets   = var.datasets
}
Step 4: Update Your Terraform Workflow
Run the following commands to apply the changes:

sh
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="datasets.tfvars"

This approach allows you to read multiple YAML files dynamically and use them in your Terraform configuration to manage BigQuery datasets and tables effectively.

I am working on google cloud, and for a proof of concept I want to create a Pub/Sub topic with defined schema, dataflow job using python apache beam which will transform the data received from Subscription and then loads into BigQuery dataset. Need this using Terraform. Also to simulate for streaming data published to Pub/Sub topic, I want to write a Python Script which will publish the message to topic with n number of messages every minute or so.
Sounds like an exciting project! I can certainly help you with that. Let's break this down step by step.

1. Create a Pub/Sub Topic with a Defined Schema
First, you'll need to define a schema for the Pub/Sub topic and create it using Terraform. Here's an example:

hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "<your-project-id>"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "example_topic" {
  name = "example-topic"
  schema_settings {
    schema = google_pubsub_schema.example_schema.id
  }
}

resource "google_pubsub_schema" "example_schema" {
  name    = "example-schema"
  type    = "AVRO"
  definition = <<EOF
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "ExampleRecord",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "value", "type": "double"}
  ]
}
EOF
}
2. Create a Dataflow Job with Python Apache Beam
Now, you'll need a Python script to create a Dataflow job using Apache Beam to transform data from the Pub/Sub subscription and load it into a BigQuery dataset.

python
import argparse
import json
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

def parse_pubsub_message(message):
    return json.loads(message.data.decode('utf-8'))

def transform_data(element):
    # Add your transformation logic here
    element['value_transformed'] = element['value'] * 2
    return element

def run(argv=None):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--project', required=True, help='Google Cloud Project ID')
    parser.add_argument('--subscription', required=True, help='Pub/Sub Subscription')
    parser.add_argument('--dataset', required=True, help='BigQuery Dataset')
    parser.add_argument('--table', required=True, help='BigQuery Table')

    args, pipeline_args = parser.parse_known_args(argv)

    pipeline_options = PipelineOptions(pipeline_args, streaming=True)

    with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:
        (p
         | 'ReadFromPubSub' >> beam.io.ReadFromPubSub(subscription=args.subscription)
         | 'ParseMessage' >> beam.Map(parse_pubsub_message)
         | 'TransformData' >> beam.Map(transform_data)
         | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
                f'{args.project}:{args.dataset}.{args.table}',
                schema='SCHEMA_AUTODETECT',
                write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND
             )
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
3. Deploy Dataflow Job using Terraform
Here's how you can deploy the Dataflow job using Terraform:

hcl
resource "google_dataflow_job" "example_job" {
  name       = "example-dataflow-job"
  template_gcs_path = "gs://dataflow-templates/latest/Streaming_Templates/Cloud_PubSub_to_BigQuery"
  parameters = {
    inputSubscription = "projects/<your-project-id>/subscriptions/<your-subscription>"
    outputTableSpec   = "<your-project-id>:<dataset>.<table>"
  }

  environment {
    temp_location = "gs://<your-temp-bucket>/temp"
    region        = "us-central1"
  }
}
4. Simulate Streaming Data to Pub/Sub
Finally, you can write a Python script to simulate publishing messages to the Pub/Sub topic:

python
import time
import json
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

def publish_messages(project_id, topic_id, n):
    publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_id)

    for i in range(n):
        message = {
            'id': str(i),
            'timestamp': time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'),
            'value': i * 1.0
        }
        publisher.publish(topic_path, json.dumps(message).encode('utf-8'))
        print(f'Published message')


--------

Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

Step 1: Create a Pub/Sub Topic with Defined Schema
You can create a Pub/Sub topic with a schema using Terraform like this:

hcl
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "my_topic" {
  name = "my-topic"

  schema_settings {
    schema = google_pubsub_schema.my_schema.name
    encoding = "JSON"
  }
}

resource "google_pubsub_schema" "my_schema" {
  name     = "my-schema"
  type     = "PROTOCOL_BUFFER"
  definition = <<EOT
syntax = "proto3";
message MyMessage {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
}
EOT
}
Step 2: Dataflow Job using Python Apache Beam
Here is an example of a Python Apache Beam script that reads from a Pub/Sub subscription and writes to BigQuery:

python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.io.gcp.bigquery import WriteToBigQuery
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
from apache_beam.io.gcp.pubsub import ReadFromPubSub

class ParseMessage(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        import json
        message = json.loads(element)
        return [message]

def run():
    options = PipelineOptions()
    p = beam.Pipeline(options=options)

    (p
     | 'ReadFromPubSub' >> ReadFromPubSub(subscription='projects/YOUR_PROJECT/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION')
     | 'ParseMessage' >> beam.ParDo(ParseMessage())
     | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> WriteToBigQuery(
            table='YOUR_PROJECT:YOUR_DATASET.YOUR_TABLE',
            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND)
    )

    p.run().wait_until_finish()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
Step 3: Terraform for Dataflow Job
You need to deploy the Dataflow job using Terraform. First, create a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store the Apache Beam script:

hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "dataflow_bucket" {
  name     = "my-dataflow-bucket"
  location = "US"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "dataflow_script" {
  name   = "dataflow_script.py"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.dataflow_bucket.name
  source = "path/to/your/dataflow_script.py"
}
Then, create a Dataflow job resource:

hcl
resource "google_dataflow_job" "dataflow_job" {
  name     = "my-dataflow-job"
  template_gcs_path = "gs://${google_storage_bucket.dataflow_bucket.name}/dataflow_script.py"
  parameters = {
    input_subscription = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION"
    output_table       = "YOUR_PROJECT:YOUR_DATASET.YOUR_TABLE"
  }
}
Step 4: Python Script to Publish Messages to Pub/Sub Topic
Here's a Python script to publish messages to a Pub/Sub topic at regular intervals:

python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
import time
import json

project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
topic_id = "YOUR_TOPIC_ID"

publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_id)

def publish_message(n):
    for i in range(n):
        data = json.dumps({'name': 'name_' + str(i), 'age': i})
        future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data.encode('utf-8'))
        print(f'Published message ID {future.result()}')
        time.sleep(1)  # Sleep for 1 second between messages

publish_message(10)  # Publish 10 messages



----------------------------------------------------------

with the terraform how to setup google cloud log sink to bigquery dataset, and also how to add specific filter on cloud logs

To set up a Google Cloud log sink to a BigQuery dataset using Terraform and add a specific filter on Cloud Logs, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create BigQuery Dataset
First, create a BigQuery dataset where you want the logs to be stored.

hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "log_dataset" {
  dataset_id = "my_log_dataset"
  project    = var.project_id
  location   = "US"
}
Step 2: Create Log Sink
Next, create a log sink to BigQuery and add a filter to select specific logs. Here’s an example of how to create a log sink with a filter:

hcl
resource "google_logging_project_sink" "log_sink" {
  name        = "my_log_sink"
  project     = var.project_id
  destination = "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/${var.project_id}/datasets/${google_bigquery_dataset.log_dataset.dataset_id}"
  filter      = "severity>=ERROR"  # Adjust this filter according to your needs

  bigquery_options {
    use_partitioned_tables = true
  }

  unique_writer_identity = true
}

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "log_sink_writer" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/bigquery.dataEditor"

  members = [
    "serviceAccount:${google_logging_project_sink.log_sink.writer_identity}",
  ]
}
Step 3: Apply Terraform Configuration
Now, apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources.

sh
terraform init
terraform apply
This setup creates a log sink in Google Cloud Logging that routes logs with a severity of ERROR or higher to a partitioned BigQuery table.

Adding Specific Filters
To add specific filters to Cloud Logs, you can modify the filter field in the google_logging_project_sink resource. Here are a few examples:

Filter for logs with a specific text:

hcl
filter = "textPayload: \"specific text\""
Filter for logs from a specific resource type:

hcl
filter = "resource.type = \"gce_instance\""
Filter for logs from a specific log name:

hcl
filter = "logName = \"projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/logs/YOUR_LOG_NAME\""
Adjust the filter according to your requirements to capture the desired logs.

---------------------------------------------------

the prurpose of the log sink is to understand the system or project and their resources better. Identify who is accessing the resources, what action the user or service account has taken; ofcourse errors is one of the main reason too, to identify the failure reason; along with this also understand the pattern etc.. you can add what else we do achive with this logs in bigquery. so suggest based on the above requirement what should be the filter.. and also how to achieve above.
To meet your needs—monitoring system and project resources, identifying who is accessing resources, understanding user or service account actions, identifying errors, and understanding patterns—we need a comprehensive log filter. This filter should capture different aspects of the logs, including access logs, audit logs, and error logs.

Here’s a suggested filter that addresses your requirements:

hcl
filter = "logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity\" OR logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event\" OR logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access\" OR severity>=WARNING"
Explanation of the Filter
logName:"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity": Captures Admin Activity logs, which include operations that modify the configuration or metadata of your resources.

logName:"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event": Captures System Event logs, which include Google Cloud system events.

logName:"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access": Captures Data Access logs, which include operations that read or write data controlled by your resources.

severity>=WARNING: Captures logs with severity WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, and EMERGENCY, to ensure you also capture all significant and critical events, including errors and potential issues.

Achieving the Above with Terraform
Here is the updated Terraform configuration:

hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "log_dataset" {
  dataset_id = "my_log_dataset"
  project    = var.project_id
  location   = "US"
}

resource "google_logging_project_sink" "log_sink" {
  name        = "my_log_sink"
  project     = var.project_id
  destination = "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/${var.project_id}/datasets/${google_bigquery_dataset.log_dataset.dataset_id}"
  filter      = "logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity\" OR logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event\" OR logName:\"logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access\" OR severity>=WARNING"

  bigquery_options {
    use_partitioned_tables = true
  }

  unique_writer_identity = true
}

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "log_sink_writer" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/bigquery.dataEditor"

  members = [
    "serviceAccount:${google_logging_project_sink.log_sink.writer_identity}",
  ]
}
Benefits of Logs in BigQuery
By routing logs to BigQuery, you can:

Analyze user and service account activities: Understand who is accessing resources and what actions they are performing.

Identify and troubleshoot issues: Investigate errors and failures to determine the root causes and take corrective actions.

Monitor system and resource usage: Gain insights into the usage patterns of your resources to optimize performance and costs.

Compliance and audit: Maintain a detailed audit trail of operations for compliance and security purposes.

Build custom dashboards and reports: Use BigQuery and tools like Google Data Studio or Looker to create visualizations and reports for monitoring and analysis.

This setup will provide comprehensive insights into your system and project, helping you achieve better visibility and control over your resources.

---------------------------------------------------

seems it is using the service account by creting it on the fly.. how could I define my own service account and grant relevant access. So modify the code to include custom service account and all required role bindings.

To meet your requirements and achieve a comprehensive understanding of your system or project, as well as resource access patterns, usage actions, error identification, and other insights, you can create a custom log sink filter to capture detailed logs.

Here's an example filter to capture logs related to accessing resources, actions taken by users or service accounts, errors, and general usage patterns:

Log Sink Filter
hcl
filter = """
logName: "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
OR logName: "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event"
OR logName: "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
OR severity>=ERROR
"""
This filter captures:

cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity: Logs for actions taken by users or service accounts.

cloudaudit.googleapis.com/system_event: Logs for system events.

cloudaudit.googleapis.com/data_access: Logs for accessing resources.

severity>=ERROR: Logs with severity ERROR or higher.

Terraform Code with Custom Service Account and Role Bindings
First, create a custom service account and grant it the relevant access roles:

hcl
resource "google_service_account" "log_sink_sa" {
  account_id   = "log-sink-service-account"
  display_name = "Log Sink Service Account"
}

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "log_sink_writer" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/bigquery.dataEditor"

  members = [
    "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.log_sink_sa.email}",

}

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "log_sink_creator" {

  role    = "roles/logging.logWriter"

  members = [

Next, create the BigQuery dataset and log sink:

hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "log_dataset" {
  dataset_id = "my_log_dataset"
  project    = var.project_id
  location   = "US"
}

resource "google_logging_project_sink" "log_sink" {
  name        = "my_log_sink"
  project     = var.project_id
  destination = "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/${var.project_id}/datasets/${google_bigquery_dataset.log_dataset.dataset_id}"
  filter      = """
logName: "projects/${var.project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
OR logName: "projects/${var.project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event"
OR logName: "projects/${var.project_id}/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
OR severity>=ERROR
"""

  bigquery_options {
    use_partitioned_tables = true
  }

  unique_writer_identity = true
  writer_identity = google_service_account.log_sink_sa.email
}
Steps to Apply the Configuration
Save the above Terraform configuration in your Terraform file.

Initialize Terraform:

sh
terraform init
Apply the Terraform configuration:

sh
terraform apply
This setup creates a BigQuery dataset, a custom service account, relevant IAM bindings, and a log sink with the specified filter. The log sink will route relevant logs to the BigQuery dataset, allowing you to analyze user actions, resource access, errors, and usage patterns.


---------------------------------------------------
In the above what does the filter conditon means.. filter = "severity>=ERROR"

The filter condition filter = "severity>=ERROR" in the Google Cloud log sink configuration means that only logs with a severity level of ERROR or higher will be captured and routed to the BigQuery dataset.

Google Cloud Logging uses the following severity levels (in order of increasing severity):

DEBUG: Debug or trace information.

INFO: Routine information, such as ongoing status or performance.

NOTICE: Normal but significant events, such as startup, shutdown, or configuration.

WARNING: Indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The service is still working as expected.

ERROR: Error events of considerable importance that will prevent normal program execution, but might still allow the application to continue running.

CRITICAL: Critical conditions, such as a component failure.

ALERT: A person must take an action immediately.

EMERGENCY: A panic condition, generally reported through the system panic reporting mechanism on UNIX systems.

By setting the filter to severity>=ERROR, you ensure that only logs with severity levels of ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, or EMERGENCY are included in the sink. This helps in focusing on significant and urgent issues, reducing noise from lower-severity logs.

You can adjust this filter based on your requirements. For example, if you want to capture all logs with a severity of WARNING or higher, you can set the filter to severity>=WARNING.
